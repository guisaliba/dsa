A selection sort algorithm takes an array of size "n" and iterates through it. For each iteration, it finds the smallest element in the array and swaps it with the element at the current index. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) and the space complexity is O(1).
<br>
We can definitely see here that there will be two loops in this algorithm.
<br>
The first to iterate through every element in the array and the second to find the smallest element in the array. The second loop will be nested inside the first loop. This is why the time complexity for this type of algorithm is O(n^2).

The first loop iterates through every element in the array until the last position of the array. That is because when the loop gets to the last element in the array (n - 1), it will already be the greatest element in the array, because the algorithm have ordered them all already. The second loop will iterate through every element from the minimum index ("i+1") to the end of the array. And that is because the second loop checks if there is another element in the array smaller than the current minimum index, so it compares every element from the current minimum beyond.
<br>
This is why the space complexity for this type of algorithm is O(1).

```JavaScript
// A = array of size n
// n = size of array
// i = current index
// j = index of the smallest element in the array

for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    let minI = i;

    for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      if (A[j] < A[minI]) {
        minI = j;
      }
    }

    let temp = A[i];
    A[i] = A[minI];
    A[minI] = temp;
  }

```
